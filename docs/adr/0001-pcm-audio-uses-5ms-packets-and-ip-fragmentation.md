# PCM audio uses 5 ms packets and relies on IP fragmentation

PCM audio at 48 kHz/16-bit is 960 B per 5 ms packet in stereo, 2880 B in 5.1 and 3840 B in 7.1, so surround packets are larger than a single datagram on a typical 1500-byte MTU. We send them whole anyway, within the 4096-byte audio packet limit that Dolby audio already depends on, and let IP fragmentation split them. The host fixes the packet duration at 5 ms whenever PCM audio is negotiated, the same way it fixes 32 ms for Dolby audio, so the codec alone tells the client how long a packet is. This keeps one audio packet per RTP packet, one packet duration for every channel layout, and 200 packets/s even in 7.1. The cost is that losing any one fragment loses the whole packet, and the 4+2 Reed-Solomon audio recovery can't rebuild a partially received packet, so on lossy networks surround PCM audio has more short gaps of silence than unfragmented packets would.

## Considered Options

- **Shortening the packet duration per channel layout so each packet fits in one datagram** (stereo 5 ms, 5.1 2 ms, 7.1 1 ms): rejected. Vibepollo already accepts fragmented audio packets for Dolby audio, and shorter packets mean a packet duration that depends on the channel layout and up to 1000 packets/s for 7.1.
- **Splitting each 5 ms frame across several RTP packets**: rejected. It needs a new header for the pieces, reassembly on the client, and recovery groups that no longer line up with whole frames.
